A quick CLI tool to sort directories by size.

The native implementation of this on MacOS wasn't quick enough to search through my mess of a file system so I wrote this to do it faster.

Usage:

Open terminal in root.

go run ./main.go

Enter path of the folder you want to search

Specify a depth.

Note: If you run this in vscode you'll want to use my launch.json so you can handle input in the terminal.
